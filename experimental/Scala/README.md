# NGSI-LD Wrapper in Scala

Our plan is to migrate the NGSI-LD Wrapper to Scala due to the following reasons:

* Less lines of code
* More agile development while keeping the robustness of the Java environment

We plan to use [Scalatra](http://scalatra.org/) as the framework on which to base the REST implementation.
